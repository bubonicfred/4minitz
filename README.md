- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/4minitz/4minitz/) - Spin up your own 4Minitz server in seconds


## Deployment Quick Start

To quickly set up a local demo of 4Minitz at your site for evaluation and
testing you can use our sample
[Docker Compose configuration file](docker-compose.yml)
and run it with

```sh
docker-compose up
```
TODO:update docker-compose
You can now access 4Minitz by pointing your browser to
[http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100).

If you don't want to use `docker-compose` you can use just docker by starting
the two containers manually:

```sh
docker run --rm --name mongo mongo
docker run --rm --name 4minitz \
    -v $PWD/4minitz_storage:/4minitz_storage \
    -p 3100:3333 \
    -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo/4minitz \
    --link mongo \
    4minitz/4minitz:stable
```

Don't miss the [Admin Guide](doc/admin/adminguide.md) with a more comprehensive
coverage of the real production building & installation topic! Especially see
[how to configure your 4Minitz docker server](doc/admin/adminguide.md#production-running---with-docker).

## Development environment (Linux, Mac)

**Attention:** This is not a proper setup for production deployment!
It is intended for developers and so it has some security drawbacks (No
password protection for MongoDB) and also consumes some amount of extra RAM
(>700 MB)). Don't miss the [Admin Guide](doc/admin/adminguide.md)
with a more comprehensive coverage of the real production installation topic!

### Prerequisites

4minitz is realized with the [Meteor JS Framework](http://www.meteor.com). So, first install the current version of meteor:

```sh
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
meteor --version
```

On Windows? [Download the meteor installer](https://install.meteor.com/windows).
As an experienced Windows admin you sure can transfer the below steps for Linux and Mac to your OS.

### Run development version (Linux & Mac)

Once Meteor is set up you can clone and run 4Minitz from source like this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/4minitz/4minitz.git
cd 4minitz
cp settings_sample.json settings.json
./runapp.sh
```

Wait some time for meteor to finish downloading and building.
You can reach 4Minitz via the default port 3100 by opening
[http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) in your browser

**Hint:** There is a settings_sample.json file that has quite a few configuration options
(like sending eMails etc.). Don't miss the [Admin Guide](doc/admin/adminguide.md) with more details
on this topic.
